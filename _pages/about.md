I am a theoretical chemist working on not-so-quantum dynamics. Right now, I am a postdoctoral fellow in [Sophya Garashchuk](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/chemistry_and_biochemistry/our_people/directory/garashchuk_sophya.php)'s group at the [Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/chemistry_and_biochemistry/index.php) of the University of South Carolina. Go Gamecocks!

I got my PhD in 2024 under [Riccardo Conte](https://sites.unimi.it/ceotto/about_RiccardoConte.html) at [Ceotto Group](https://sites.unimi.it/ceotto/index.html), University of Milan. In my PhD thesis I developed (some) and applied (many) methods of semiclassical dynamics to unravel some interesting vibrational spectra. I got both my BSc and MSc in Ceotto Group too!

You will find my resum√© [here](assets/pdf/GBotti_resume.pdf).
