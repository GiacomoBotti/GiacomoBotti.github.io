### Quantum Trajectory Adaptable Gaussian basis

I just started my PostDoc under [Sophya Garashchuk](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/chemistry_and_biochemistry/our_people/directory/garashchuk_sophya.php), with the goal of developing methods and codes to advance the Quantum Trajectory Adaptable Gaussian basis methods. Keep your eyes open!

### Semiclassical dynamics

             A classical trajectory follows the least-action principle. In the Path Integral framework, a quantum system     evolves following all the possible trajectories. In the semiclassical formulation, only the classical trajectories are considered, but quantum effects are added

During my BSc, MSc and finally PhD, I worked with semiclassical dynamics applied to the vibrational spectrum under the supervision of [Riccardo Conte](https://sites.unimi.it/ceotto/about_RiccardoConte.html) and [Michele Ceotto](https://sites.unimi.it/ceotto/about_michele.html). In my BSc, I developed a method to speed up the Hessian matrix computation, a well-known bottleneck of semiclassical dynamics.[[1]](/publications#Conte2019). Then, in my MSc I fitted multiple potential energy surfaces for formaldehyde using Bowman's Permutationally Invariant Polynomials, computing the energies with different levels of theory and basis sets. The goal was testing the accuracy of the semiclassical methods at any given level of theory and basis set.[[2]](/publications#Conte_Ceotto_formaldehydePESs_2020) Finally, during my PhD I developed an *on-the-fly* application for adiabatically switched semiclassical dynamics,[[3]](/publications#Botti2021) and I applied it to unravel the elusive spectrum of Proline.[[4]](/publications#Botti2022) I then moved to Paris, hosted by [F. Finocchi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3BkDDlIAAAAJ&hl=en) at CNRS Sorbonne Universit√©, to find the signs of tunneling in the vibrational spectrum of the Guanine-Cytosine dimer.[[5]](/publications#Botti2023) Finally, I took part in the [Ceotto Group](https://sites.unimi.it/ceotto/index.html) effort to clarify the differences between classical and quantum spectra.[[6]](/publications#Conte2023)[[7]](/publications#Conte2024)

At the moment, I still using my semiclassical toolbox on
 - investigating DMSO microsolvation from a vibrational point of view, with [Marco Paolantoni](https://www.unipg.it/personale/marco.paolantoni)
 - understanding "a rather universal resonance" discovered by Suhm and coworkers in carbonyl monohydrates
 - formalizing the difference between *classical* combination bands and *quantum* combination bands
