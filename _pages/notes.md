During my studies at [Universit√† degli Studi di Milano](https://www.unimi.it/it), I typed all my notes in $\LaTeX$.

Later, thanks to some of my friends, these notes were collected in a single website, for all UniMI students to use, freely.

You can still find them there, at [Inquinamento ChiMIco](https://inquinamentochimico.wordpress.com/). *Pauca sed matura!*
