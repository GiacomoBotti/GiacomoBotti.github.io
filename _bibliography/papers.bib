    abstract = {The investigation of nuclear quantum effects in solvated systems is still a challenge. In this perspective, we demonstrated the validity of semiclassical method for treating nuclear quantum effects both in vibrational spectroscopy
    and reaction kinetics. My contribution was using semiclassical initial value representation to reproduce the quantum vibrational features found in the spectra of carbonyl monohydrates, in particular the combination band between a libration mode and the water bending overtone. This combination band resonates with the hydrogen-bonded OH stretching, borrowing its intesity. Since this combination band involves an overtone, it cannot be properly described without quantum effects. We conclude that semiclassical approaches do account for real-time quantum contributions and are expected to point out the importance of nuclear quantum effects in complex systems for a wider range of chemical properties.}

This paper investigates the differences between methods based on classical mechanics and methods capable of including quantum effects. My contribution was applying adiabatic switching quantization to the calculation of formaldehyde vibrational eigenvalues. The conclusions were that while the classical methods cannot reproduce nuclear quantum effects and heavily depend on the simulation energy, methods that are derived from Schrödinger equation, such as semiclassical initial value representation, include quantum effects such as zero point energy, overtones and combination bands, and their results do not depend on the temperature.},

   abstract = {Proline is the cornerstone of proteins, playing a pivotal role in protein folding, regulation of metabolism and asymmetric catalysis. Nonetheless, its vibrational spectrum was not assigned on solid grounds and the presence of more than one conformer was still a matter of discussion. In this paper, I used the recently developed ab initio adiabatic switching semiclassical dynamics to obtain an accurate estimate of proline vibrational frequencies. The thorough assignment concluded that there are two conformers in the experimental spectrum, one of them characterized by an elusive OH stretching signal due to an internal hydrogen bond.},

   abstract = {When running semiclassical dynamics on-the-fly, one has to compromise between the computational effort and the accuracy of the ab initio energy. To understand the effects of the level of theory on the semiclassical vibrational spectrum, we compared the spectra of formaldehyde, obtained with Permutationally Invariant Polynomials (PIP) PES. These PESs were fitted on around 34000 single point energies computed with different basis sets on DFT, MP2 and CCSD(T) level of theory. In this paper, I computed the single point energies and Morse coordinates required for the PIP fitting. I then used the PIP PES to compute the semiclassical vibrational spectra of formaldehyde. From this comparison, it was concluded that the main factor in semiclassical spectra accuracy is the accuracy of the potential, but -- even at DFT level -- semiclassical methods are a drastic improvement with respect to other more common methods, such as harmonic frequencies.},

   abstract = {In ab initio semiclassical spectroscopy, the spectrum is collected from a single, tailored trajectory using methods such as Ceotto's MCSCIVR. However, classical trajectories are inherently chaotic, so the choice of the quantized initial conditions is crucial. The use of an adiabatic switching procedure can improve the inital conditions quantization, thus reducing the chaotic behaviour. In this paper, I implemented adiabatic switching with ab initio potential energies and forces and tested its capabilities on a series of molecular systems. On-the-fly adiabatic switching has proven to be a relatively cheap improvement for ab initio semiclassical vibrational spectroscopy and can now be applied using both NWChem and Orca suites.},

@article{Conte2019,
   abstract = {One of the main bottlenecks in semiclassical dynamics is the computation of the Hessian matrices at each step of the trajectory. These matrices are required to evolve the prefactor, which adds quantum effects on classical trajectories. To cut the computational time, one can recycle the computed Hessian matrices, exploiting the trajectory quasi-periodicity. This method is called Hessian Database. In this paper, I helped establishing the Hessian Database procedure by testing multiple store-and-fetch algorithms, finally selecting the best one that was then optimized and adapted for on-the-fly ab initio dynamics. Hessian Database is now fundamental for using ab initio semiclassical vibrational spectroscopy on systems of medium-to-large size. },

In this paper, I used ab initio semiclassical vibrational spectroscopy to investigate the presence of tunneling in the IR-UV hole-burning spectra of gas-phase guanine-cytosine pair. By comparing the semiclassical spectra with both the velocity autocorrelation spectra and the experimental ones, I was able to confirm the previous experimental assignment and to exclude the presence of the tunneling product and of any other tunneling sign in the experimental spectrum.}
